            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Old Trafford is a football stadium in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, and the home of Man
                chester United. With a capacity of 74,140 seats, it is the largest club football stadium (and second-lar
                gest football stadium overall after Wembley Stadium) in the United Kingdom, and the eleventh-largest in E
                urope. It is about 0.5 miles (800 m) from Old Trafford Cricket Ground and the adjacent tram stop.Nicknamed "The Theatre of Dreams" by Bobby Charlton, Old Trafford has been United's home ground 
                since 1910, although from 1941 to 1949 the club shared Maine Road with local rivals Manchester City as a result of Second World War bomb damage.Old Trafford underwent several expansions in the 1990s and 2000s, 
                including the addition of extra tiers to the North, West and East Stands, almost returning the stadium to its original capacity of 80,000. Future expansion is likely to involve the additi
                on of a second tier to the South Stand, which would raise the capacity to around 88,000. </p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <img src="pictures/sir alex.webp">
            <p>In the first decade of the 20th century, Manchester United played their home matches at a 
                50,000-stadium at Bank Street, when then president Davies began planning for a new stadiu
                m with double that capacity. A site was chosen near Trafford Park industrial estate, and archit
                ect Archibald Leitch was appointed to design the stadium.n 1939, Old Trafford recorded its highest attendan
                ce of 76,962 during an FA Cup semi-final match between Wolves and Grimsby Town.Due to its proximity to Trafford Park in
                dustrial estate, Old Trafford got heavily damaged by German air raids during World War 2. It took eight years to rebuilt the s
                tadium, the delays being caused by limited post-war resources, and during that time United played at Maine Road, the gro
                und of rivals Manchester City.In 1949, Man United moved back to a reconstructed, though smaller, Old Trafford. Incremental impr
                ovements and expansions were made in the following decades, which culminated in the complete renovation of the United Road (North) St
                and in the 1960s. This stand also held the first private boxes to be constructed at a British ground.Sir Alexander Chapman Ferguson CBE (born 31 December 1941)
                is a Scottish former football manager and player, best known for managing Manchester United from 1986 to 2013. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest managers of all time
                and has won more trophies than any other manager in the history of football.
                Ferguson is often credited for valuing youth during his time with Manchester United,
                particularly in the 1990s with the "Class of '92", who contributed to making the club one of the richest and most successful in the world.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <img src="pictures/Pep G.jpg">
            <p>The history of Manchester City Football Club, a professional football club based in Manchester, England, dates back to the club's
                formation in 1880 by members of St. Mark's Church of England in West Gorton. Manchester City have won thirty-four major honours throughout their history: nine league titles, seven FA Cups, eight League Cups,
                six FA Charity/Community Shields,
                one UEFA Champions League, one European Cup Winners' Cup,one UEFA Super Cup,and one FIFA Club World Cup.On 1 February 2016, Manchester City signed Guardiola 
                to a three-year contract for the start of the 2016–17 season.As of the end of the 2021–22 season, Manchester City had won four league titles in five seasons under Guardiola's reign, retaining them on two occasions. They had twice won the title by a single point from Liverpool, in the process developing a fierce new rivalry, that also
                translated to managers Guardiola and Jürgen Klopp,
                as well as the fans of the respective clubs. Guardiola had also guided City to their first ever Champions League final, and a further semi-finals, which was lost in dramatic circumstances to Real Madrid. The 2020–21 and 2021–22 seasons were also notable as the end of City's record goalscorer Sergio Agüero's
                career at the club after 10 seasons and 260 goals. The Blues struggled to immediately
                recruit a replacement and so employed
                a false nine role extensively in accomplishing their objectives these seasons.However, with the European success eluding the brilliant City squad, some pundits and fans like still questioned
                whether that side would go down in history as one of the greatest of all time. The 2022–23 season rendered all those talking points irrelevant, as Manchester City won their third consecutive Premier League title, the FA Cup final against rivals Manchester United, and, most importantly, their maiden Champions League title, thereby assembling a rare feat – the continental treble.
                The road to the Champions League victory included convincing victories over the perennial favorites and European giants Bayern Munich, who were defeated 4–1 on aggregate, and Real Madrid, who suffered a 1–5 aggregate loss at the hands of City after their controversial 6–5 extra time victory at the same stage a year before.</p>
