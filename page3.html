        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Immerse yourself in the ultimate shopping
        , dining, and entertainment experience at the
        Trafford Centre, situated in Stretford, Manchester.If you’re on a city break to Manchester and the weather’s being a bit British, escape the elements at the
        Trafford Centre. This indoor shopping mall is seriously huge, with over 280 stores selling designer clobber and high street faves. But if you’d rather stick pins
        in your eyes than spend the day dragging around the shops, you’ll still find something to do here. As much a theme park as a shopping mall, there’s the 20-screen Trafford
        Centre cinema, rock climbing centre, high ropes course and more.An estimated 31 million people visit the Trafford Centre annually so it does get quite manic, particularly at the weekends.
        Beat the queues by going at the quietest times. These are Monday to Wednesday, 10am to 12pm. Also, take comfortable shoes - the Trafford centre is second only to the Metrocentre in Newcastle in terms of retail size.
        You’ll feel like you’ve walked a marathon.The gigantic retail and leisure development at Trafford was finally completed in 1998, but it was so controversial, it nearly didn’t get made at all.
The site at Dumplington, just five miles west of the city centre, was originally owned by the Manchester Ship Canal Company. In 1986 the company was bought by Peel Holdings, who wanted to build a huge out-of-town shopping centre on the land.
Many objected, fearful of the traffic jams and threat to local retailers a huge shopping mall might cause. There followed the longest and most expensive planning processes in the history of the UK, settled only by the House of Lords in 1996 who voted in favour of the development.
The 60-hectare project took 27 months to complete at a cost of £600 million (an eye-watering £1 billion in today’s money). The mall’s major buildings were joined together by glazed malls to create five different areas; Regent Crescent, The Dome, Peel Avenue, Festival Village and the Orient Restaurant and Leisure Dome.
In 2008, two further extensions, Barton Square and the Great Hall, were added to create the vast complex the Trafford Centre is today.
Its fabulously over-the-top décor was designed to reflect the building’s heritage - the spectacular Orient food court is themed as a 1930s steam-powered ship to honour the centre’s links to the Manchester Ship Canal.</p>
        
        <h2>Shopping and Entertainment</h2>
        <img src="pictures/selfridges.webp">
        <p>This luxurious marble mall plays host to a year-round calendar of exciting events. Whenever you visit there’ll be something going on,
            from magical Christmas wonderlands and fireworks displays, to sampling vans, tempting you to try their freebies. The best place to head for is the Orient
            food court as it holds everything from tea dances to pop star-performances on
            its main stage.
            
            There are almost 280 outlets at the Trafford Centre, so all the major (and quite a few minor) brands are represented. There’s designer labels like Armani, 
            Calvin Klein and Michael Kors rubbing shoulders with high-street staples like Top Shop, Oasis and Lakeland. There are also four department stores - John Lewis,
            Selfridges, M&S and Debenhams.
            
            If shopping’s not your bag, take in a film at the 20-screen Odeon Trafford Centre cinema, go bowling on one of Namco 18 lanes or do battle with a 14-year-old nemesis at Laser Quest.
            And, with an 18-hole adventure golf course, rock climbing centre and a Legoland Discovery thrown into the mix, you can spend the day here without ever setting foot into a shop.
            
            There’s a big soft play area, plus a crèche facility for two to nine-year-olds that’s so fun they won’t even know you’re gone.
            Security wristbands are available at customer services in the Main Dome, and to put an end to whining, why not hire them a fun buggy?
            These miniature cars can be picked up for a small cost at customer services on Lower Peel Avenue.
            
            All car parks have Blue-Badge spaces, but Peel Avenue 9, near John Lewis and M&S, has the most. There are lots of disabled toilets within each of the centre’s five main toilet blocks.
            If walking’s an issue, there’s also a Shopmobility centre on the lower level by John Lewis. Electric wheelchairs and scooters can be hired here at a small cost during opening hours.
