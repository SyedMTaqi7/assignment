        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <p>Hey there, I'm Taqi, currently navigating the exciting
        world of IT as a level 2 student. My sights are set on becoming
        a software engineer, and I thought I'd share a bit about my
        journey and where I'm headed.</p>
        
        <p>I'm concentrating in my level 2 IT studies, soaking up
        everything this field has to offer. It's a dynamic space, and I'm
        loving every bit of the challenge</p>
        
        <p>I've got this big dream of becoming a software engineer.
        The idea of creating something from scratch, innovating, and
        being on the frontline of tech developments gets me fired up.</p>
        
        <p>I had a chat with my academic advisor about moving to Level 3.
        Got some advice on courses and what steps to take. Im thinking about
        boosting my skills, focusing on areas like programming languages,
        software design, and project management.</p>
        
        <p>That's where I'm at - navigating this journey from level 2 to
        level 3. Excited for what's ahead!</p>
