        <p>Immerse yourself in the rich history and diverse collections at
        the Manchester Museum. Here's everything you need to know for your visit:</p>
        
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <p>Manchester Museum is a leading cultural
        institution showcasing a vast collection of
        artifacts, specimens, and exhibits spanning
        civilizations and time periods.Manchester Museum, one of the largest university museu
        ms in the UK, is over one hundred and thirty years old.
The original neo-Gothic building was designed by renowned architect Alfred Waterhouse (1830–1
905) and is home to around four and a half million objects from natural scienc
es and human cultures. It has always been a place for research and learning, and
we are a critical part of the city’s research infrastructure today.The museum charged for the admission of non-members, includi
ng the working classes, but by the 1860s the
middle-class membership was falling. The museum first looked to local go
vernment for support, but it was Owens College, founded in 1851, which ag
reed to take the collections.By 1887, however, the college's supporters had funded and built a large gothic museum, at the front of the college quadrangle. It connected with the Beyer Building which housed geology and zoo
logy and botany, and, like the other college buildings, it was designed by Alfred Waterhouse. Thomas Henry Huxley had advised on the principles of the building, while William Boyd Dawkins had developed the 
galleries, first as curator to the Natural History Society and then as Professor of Geology at the college. The new galleries were to be used by college staff and students, but they were also open to the public. The Manchester 
has been extended several times, usually to accommodate new kin
ds of collections.</p>

        <p>Mummies, gold and an obsessive belief in the afterlife. These concepts are all central to our image of ‘Ancient Egypt’. But how important were they to the Egyptians, and how long did they survive after the last of the Pharaohs?
            Golden Mummies of Egypt explores expectations of a life after death during the relatively little-known ‘Graeco-Roman’
            Period of Egyptian history – when Egypt was ruled first by a Greek royal family, ending with Queen Cleopatra VII, then by Roman emperors (between 300 BCE and 300 CE). Wealthy members of this multicultural
            society made elaborate preparations for the afterlife, combining Egyptian, Greek, and Roman ideals of eternal beauty.
        Manchester Museum cares for 18,000 objects from Egypt and Sudan. Excavated at a time of British rule of Egypt in the 1880s-1910s, our responses to these objects may reveal more about ourselves than about the people who made and used them. Keep scrolling to find out more!Explore captivation exhibits, from
        ancient Egyptian artifacts to contemporary
        art, offering a fascinating journey through the
        tapestry of human history.the largest collection of L.S Lowry‘s work has to be on display at his namesake gallery, and The Lowry boasts its most comprehensive selection ever.
        Lowry’s so-called ‘matchstick men‘ populate his paintings based on locations around the North West where he spent most of his life, especially Pendlebury, Lancashire, and often
        evoke a familiarity in northerners,whether through the industrial landscapes they portray, or familiar activities such as ‘Going To Work‘ or milling around a ‘Market Scene‘.</p>
